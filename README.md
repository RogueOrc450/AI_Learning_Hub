The AI Learning Hub is a group of alums of the UT McComb School AI/ML postgraduate program who have decided to work together on a new AI project including Langchain. We will work together through a five-phase process to create 
1. a basic chatbot
2. a scripted salesbot with a recommendation system
3. a salesbot fine-tuned using RAG
4. incorporating text-to-speech
5. an AI assistant that uses multiple agents
